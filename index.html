       <h1>Timothy Viccari</h1>

        <p>Born in FL in 1984 Tim joined the Army and became an infantryman in the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne Division. 
        After that he met his future wife in university, and calmed down a (very) little bit. 
        His career has been in the insurance industry and drifted more into the startup/tech world over the past few years.
